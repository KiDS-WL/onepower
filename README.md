**TATOOINE**  
*Tools for Analyzing Two-point and One-point cOrrelations, Intrinsic alignments, and Nonlinear structurE*


> ‚ÄúModeling small-scale structure in a galaxy not so far away.‚Äù


TATOOINE is a Python package for computing power spectra and one-point statistics using the halo model framework. It is designed for studying the galaxy‚Äìmatter connection, cosmological structure formation, and intrinsic alignments, especially in the non-linear regime.

### Features
- Non-linear **matter‚Äìmatter**, **galaxy‚Äìgalaxy**, and **galaxy‚Äìmatter** power spectra
- Predictions of **stellar mass functions** and / or **luminosity functions**
- Modeling of **intrinsic alignments** using the halo model approach
- Built on a flexible, extensible halo model architecture

### TATOOINE is ideal for:

- Forward modeling of galaxy surveys
- Cosmological parameter inference
- Understanding the galaxy‚Äìhalo connection in nonlinear regimes

### Installation

```bash
pip install tatooine
```

### Example usage

```
from tatooine import Spectra

ps = Spectra(...)
pk_mm = ps.power_spectrum_mm.pk_tot
pk_mm_1h = ps.power_spectrum_mm.pk_1h
pk_mm_2h = ps.power_spectrum_mm.pk_2h
```
