# A halo model for CosmoSIS

This repository originated from the IA halo model repository of
Maria-Cristina Fortuna.

It is a bolt-on to the [CosmoSIS standard library](https://github.com/joezuntz/cosmosis-standard-library), and uses python functions from
the [halo mass function calculator, hmf](https://hmf.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.4/) and [halomod](https://github.com/halomod/halomod).
