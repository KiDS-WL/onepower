# A halo model for CosmoSIS

This repository originated from the IA halo model repository of
Maria-Cristina Fortuna and it is a bolt-on to the [CosmoSIS standard library](https://github.com/joezuntz/cosmosis-standard-library).

You will also need to install python functions from:

1. The [halo mass function calculator, hmf](https://hmf.readthedocs.io/en/3.3.4/)
2. [halomod](https://github.com/halomod/halomod).
3. The [Dark Emulator](https://dark-emulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
