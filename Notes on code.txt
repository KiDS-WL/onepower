Notes on code: 

hmf_and_hbf.py: This is now slower than CAMB.

This section at the end of setup gives and error. Why is it written like this? 
check_mead = options.has_value(option_section, 'use_mead2020_corrections')


# This is the slow part: 0.4-0.5 seconds per call, called separately for each redshift. 
    # z_vec is actually just a single z value. 
    # Possible solution: See if we can get away with a smaller numbr of redshifts and interpolate.
    tic = time.perf_counter()
    c, ms = colossus_concentration.concentration(M=mass, z=z_vec, mdef=mdef.colossus_name, model=model,
            range_return=True, range_warning=False)
    toc = time.perf_counter()
    print(" colossus_concentration.concentration: "+'%.4f' %(toc - tic)+ "s")


hod interface:

Change the name of cf_lib.py

zmin = 0.0 0.2 ;There is overlap in zmin and zmax will this be an issues
zmax = 0.2 0.5

Change the suffix names to be full names


Combine hod outputs
