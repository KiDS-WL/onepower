Notes on code: 

hmf_and_hbf.py: This is now slower than CAMB.

This section at the end of setup gives and error. Why is it written like this? 
check_mead = options.has_value(option_section, 'use_mead2020_corrections')


# This is the slow part: 0.4-0.5 seconds per call, called separately for each redshift. 
    # z_vec is actually just a single z value. 
    # Possible solution: See if we can get away with a smaller numbr of redshifts and interpolate.
    tic = time.perf_counter()
    c, ms = colossus_concentration.concentration(M=mass, z=z_vec, mdef=mdef.colossus_name, model=model,
            range_return=True, range_warning=False)
    toc = time.perf_counter()
    print(" colossus_concentration.concentration: "+'%.4f' %(toc - tic)+ "s")


hod interface:

zmin = 0.0 0.2 ;There is overlap in zmin and zmax will this be an issues
zmax = 0.2 0.5


HOD interface creates the exact same HOD for different z-bins. Why do we make copies of it? 
block.put_grid(hod_section_name, 'z', z_bins[nb], 'mass', mass, 'n_sat'+suffix, n_sat)

Places where hod is read from the block:

add_and_upsample.py

First conflict:  File "/Users/masgari/Documents/CosmicShear/repos//halomodel_for_cosmosis/add_and_upsample.py", line 214, in execute
    hod_bins_red = block['hod' + suffix0_red + '_metadata', 'nbins']
                   ~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


pk_interface.py --> reads in hod_section_name

extrapolate_obs suffixes and variable names.

Add default values for trans_1hto2h and poisson


Where are the outputs of extrapolate _obs used?
